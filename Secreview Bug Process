==Document Purpose==
This document describes the lifecycle of bugs used for engaging the Security
teams in security review activities. This may include bugs for OpSec or ApSec review.

Note: This does not cover [[Security/Process/Vendor Reviews|Vendor Reviews]] or [[Privacy/Technical_Privacy_Reviews]]

==Initiating the Process==
Bugs enter the process in one of 2 ways:
# The flag '''sec-review''' is set to '''?''' 
#* ''Notes:'' 
#** ''Not used for bugs not already in Security Assurance component.''
#** ''Do not set a requestee for the flag as that interferes with triage.''
# A new bug is created in the '''Security Assurance: Review Request''' component

* Bugs will be triaged weekly by the Security Program Management team (currently Wednesdays at 2pm PST).
* For urgent security reviews, please contact XXXX ?

=== Bugs using sec-review ? ===
* The sec-review requestee will be set to a member of the team who will prefrom the neccessary work.
* Bugs with work estimate < 1hr 
** Notes of the work preformed will be direclty logged in the bug as a comment. Any security sensitive issues found will be filled in the same component and block the original bug with appropriate security flags set.
* Bugs with work estimate > 1hr
** The assigned requestee will file a bug in the '''Security Assurance: Review Request''' assigned to themselves and blocking the bug with the sec-review ? flag
* Follow the process below.

===Security Assurance: Review Request===
# Create a bug in the '''Security Assurance: Review Request''' and assign to nobody
#* If both appsec and opsec involvemnet is needed seperate bugs need to be filled
#** Add OPSec to the summary for OpSec involvement
# block the feature bug with request bug 
# In comment 0 please answer the questions below

==== Questions to Address within Request Body ====
#Who is/are the point of contact(s) for this review?
#Please provide a short description of the feature / application (e.g. problem solved, use cases, etc.):
#Please provide links to additional information (e.g. feature page, wiki) if available and not yet included in feature description:
#Does this request block another bug? If so, please indicate the bug number
#This review will be scheduled amongst other requested reviews. What is the urgency or needed completion date of this review?
#To help prioritize this work request, does this project support a goal specifically listed on this quarter's goal list?  If so, which goal?
#Please answer the following few questions: (Note: If you are asked to describe anything, 1-2 sentences shall suffice.)
#*Does this feature or code change affect Firefox, Thunderbird or any product or service the Mozilla ships to end users?
#*Are there any portions of the project that interact with 3rd party services?

#If you feel something is missing here or you would like to provide other kind of feedback, feel free to do so here (no limits on size):
#Desired Date of review (if known from https://mail.mozilla.com/home/ckoenig@mozilla.com/Security%20Review.html) and whom to invite.

== Triage Process ==
* The Security Program Management Team will use the triage queries from [[Security/Radar/Triage]]
* Bugs marked '''sec-review''' flag set to '''?'''
# Evaluate the bug to determin if security work is needed
** if no work is determined as needed the flag will be cleared and comment placed in the bug as such
** assigne a security resource in the requestee for the flag
* Bugs marked as triage needed in the Security Assurance Component
** Set '''Assigned To:''' to an appropriate member of the team to preform the review
** remove '''[triage needed]''' from the whiteboard if present
* Bugs in the Security Assurance component that are not assigned (nobody)
** Set '''Assigned To:''' to an appropriate member of the team to preform the review

== Post Triage ==
To be preformed by the bug assignee or flag requestee

# Remove any whiteboard tags that may have been missed by the triage team
# If set as the requestee on a sec-review ? flag estimate work time and follow the process above to preform the work of 
# When the bug mets the critera for a being assigned to a sprint per the [[Security/Process/Agile|Security Agile Process]] add the following to the whiteboard '''u= c=  p=1 s=ready''' so the bug may be triaged and assigned a to a sprint.
#* The bug will be assinged to a Sprint (or sprints as neccessary) for the work to be completed.

'''Note:''' If a bug needs to be reassigned add '''[triage needed]''' to the whiteboard or remvoe the requestee on the sec-review flag

===Completion Steps===
* If work is completed in a bug via a sec-review flag
*# Ensure all notes are made in comments of the bug to convey work done or findings
*# Set the sec-review flag to + if completed and - if failed

* If work is done in a Secuirty Assurance bug
*# Make notes in bug as necessary and ensure all issue found block both the review bug and the component bug or file in proper component
*# Set bug status to RESOLVED > FIXED

** If there are no blocking bugs or all blocking bugs are resolved then mark the bug VERIFIED > FIXED
