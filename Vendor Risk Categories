<b><center>Vendor Review Security Criteria<br>
(DRAFT 2013.12.31)</center></b>

 To Do:
 * Needs final sign off from managers
 * Review from team

= Purpose: =
In order to better deploy resources and set expectations for the level of work in the Mozilla Vendor Review process it is necessary to roughly classify projects into risk categories. Each tier has a set of characteristics meant to help in project categorization as well as a set of requirements that must be concluded for a review to be considered complete. 
All reviews will begin with the a set of questions [1] that seek to gather the basic information about the system to be acquired and help us in the initial categorization of the review.
