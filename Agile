* [http://standu.ps/team/security-assurance Security Assurance standu.ps]

* [Risk Rating table] https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/RiskRatings

==Preclearance criteria==
Bugs that need risk review:
* Bugs not ready for a full appsec/opsec review but need a risk level assigned
** If a bug does not have a [score= in the whiteboard we will assume the bug is in this category

Bugs that need architecture review:
* Bug has a risk rating of medium or higher
* Architecture diagrams are provided by the development team

Bugs ready for code review:
* Bug has a risk review (i.e.[score=low] in the whiteboard)
* Code is complete and link to itâ€™s repository has been provided
* If necessary, a staging/dev environment has been provided for us that we can use to test against
* Architecture/data flow or other diagrams have been provided by the development team appropriate for the level of risk identified for the bug

==Sprint Entrance==
When a bug meets preclearance criteria
* Add '''u= c= p=1 s=ready''' to the whiteboard of the bug
** This marks the bug for consideration during sprint triage
* Every 2 weeks on Wed after the normal Security Bug Triage all bugs so marked will be considered
** If accepted '''s=''' will be altered with a sprint. (''ie. s=sprint2'')
** Sprints  begin the Monday following a sprint triage

==Standups==
Standups are needed during a sprint to report on progress and adjust the sprint if necessary and to identify and remove any blockers to progress.
At the current time the security team is using /http://standu.ps/team/security-assurance
* Updates can be made directly on the site by Persona identified users
* Updates can also be made by messages to the bot in the appropriate IRC channel for the given team
** ''#AppSec'' for Application Security (Web sits, web services, etc.)
** ''#ClientSec'' for Client Security (Firefox, Thunderbird, Fuzzing, etc.)
** ''#FxOSSec'' for Firefox OS Security 
** These updates are not meant to be minute by minute updates, but to highlight the plans for the day and any blockers this helps keep a historic record and adjust a sprint if needed for maximum success
* ''Standu.ps'' supports the use of hashtags at current we are only using the '''#blocker''' tag to mark blocking issues

==Sprint Reporting==
* If a bug can not be completd (RESOLVED-FIXED) during a sprint then its future status needs to be communicated to the Scrum Master
Examples Include:
# Bugs that entered only for risk ranking and need to be assigned to a future sprint
# Bugs that have work that will take multiple sprints to complete (longer than 2 weeks)
# Bugs that have blockers or encounter other issues that cuase them for any reason not to close
